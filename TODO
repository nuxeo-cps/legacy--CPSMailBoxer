TODO Dolce: $Id$
- Add a new input parameter to limit the size of incoming emails (at the list
  level)
- Fix the error occuring when accepting/rejecting a mail in moderation mode
  if the user is not already logged in CPS
- Provide a GUI for mail moderation (the current mechanism only relies on
  MailBoxer's facilities and is not well integrated with CPS)
- CPSMailArchive workflow should only be defined in CPSMailBoxerFolder
- Check that 1st mail of the month archival problem in moderation mode has
  really disappeared
