TODO Dolce: $Id$
- Add a new input parameter to limit the size of incoming emails (at the list
  level)
- Provide a GUI for mail moderation (the current mechanism only relies on
  MailBoxer's facilities and is not well integrated with CPS)
- CPSMailArchive workflow should only be defined in CPSMailBoxerFolder
